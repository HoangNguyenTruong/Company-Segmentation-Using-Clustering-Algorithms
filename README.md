# Company-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-Algorithms
This repository contains all codes (Python), dataset for company segmentation using clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)

## Goal of this project 
Clustering company performance Identifying patterns, segmenting firms based on financial characteristics to deliver data-driven decisions for investment, risk management, and strategic decision-making.

## Data Description
The data provided is of some financial indicators

Net Cash Flow: The difference between a company's cash inflows and outflows from operations

EPS (Earnings Per Share): Company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding

Outstanding Share: Company's stock currently held by all its shareholders

Market Capital: Company's value in the stock market

P/E Ratio: Ratio of the company's current stock price to the earnings per share

## Results of the project

* K-Means
  
This results in 3 segment. First segment is about small-scale enterprises or underperforming companies with weak financial stability. Second segment consists of large corporations with strong financial backing but room for operational improvements. Companies in third segment can be classified as medium company which have high-performing and growth-oriented businesses.

* DBSCAN

This results in only 2 segment. First segment is about Firms in this cluster are likely small to medium-sized enterprises with stable but moderate financial performance, characterized by lower risk exposure and predictable cash flows. Second segment consists of Companies in this cluster likely include both large corporations with aggressive financial strategies and high-risk firms experiencing significant volatility in earnings and cash flow.
